# CTF Sripts

Just a bunch of automation scripts or exploits I wrote while playing CTFs
(or some [coding challenges](https://github.com/nair0lf32/challenger))
Here mostly for re-usability (Yeah I am just that lazy).
you guessed those will be mostly in python buuut...

Some of those might be linked later to writeups (If I am not too lazy)

I write them on [zerOne](https://dev.nairolf32.com/zerOne) my cybersecurity blog.

## Usage

I could let you figure it yourself but it's quite simple:

- scripts are named after the challenge I am solving
- scripts are placed in subfolders corresponding to the challenge platform
- if the script requires multiple files to work (crypto challs much) I add all that in a subfolder
