# CTF Sripts

just a bunch of automation scripts or exploits I wrote while playing ctf

(here mostly for re-usability...Yeah I am  just that lazy)

you guessed those will be mostly in python buuut...

## Usage

I could let you figure it yourself but it's quite simple:

- scripts are named after the challenge I am solving
- scripts are placed in subfolders corresponding to the challenge platform 
- if the script requires multiple files to work (crypto challs much) I add all that in a subfolder

yup...basically
